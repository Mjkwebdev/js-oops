// 4 pillars of OOPs
Encapsulation 
Abstraction 
inheritance 
Polymorphism


A group of related variable and use object as property and methods
Think of car that car has some property and methods 
Real programming example : Local storage 

A group related variabe and methods that operate on them is called encapsulation  
Encapsulation:  packing of data and functions into one component
reduce complexity + increase reusbility

Abstration:Hide some properties and  make interface simplier and that reduce the impact of change 
Hide details and reduce complexity+ Isolate impact of change

Inheritance: mechanism allows you to reduce the reductant ConvolverNode
Eliminate reductant code

Polymorphism: techniques that has many forms 
// Refuse to use switch/else nasty code
