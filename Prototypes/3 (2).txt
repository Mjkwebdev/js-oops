Prototypes and prototypical inheritance

Prototype means parent 
every object has a Prototype except the one object(proto)
All objects are related to objectBase

Prototypes are regular objects in JavaScript:
In JavaScript, every object has a prototype, which is regular object.
The prototype is used as a template from which to create new objects.

Prototypical inheritance is a direct link to an object's root:

Prototypical inheritance is a mechanism in JavaScript where objects inherit directly from other objects.
When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself, 
and if it's not found, it looks on the object's prototype, and so on up the prototype chain until it finds
the property or method, or reaches the end of the chain.
